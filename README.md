# Local Search for Problem NQueens

<p>The LS algorithm is the basis of many methods used for optimization problems. Your process can be seen as iterative starting with an initial solution and improving it by making local modifications. Its system is based on the search for neighborhoods that obtain a better solution. </p>
<p>The neighborhood search and pivot rule used for replacement are usually:</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Select the best neighbor of all (best-improvement rule).</li>
  <li>Select the first neighbor that improves the solution (first-improvement rule).</li>
</ol>
